# About

This repository serves as a personal roadmap, documenting things that I have learned as well as containing a list of things I still intend, Lord willing, to learn as it relates to software development. It also functions as a central location to display links to my most relevant projects on GitHub. Finally, this repository will be a place for me to practice various coding fundamentals and to preserve that practice for future reference. 

# How to Use

The files in this repository do not represent a single project but rather are a place for me to upload my practice of various coding languages/tools. The Personal Roadmap section details what I have spent time learning up until this point and the things I would like to learn going forward. The Project Links section contains links to my projects here on GitHub that I would like to display. 

# Personal Roadmap

<h2>I have gained a solid understanding of the following:</h2>

  <strong>-IDE's: Visual Studio 2019-2022 and Visual Studio Code
  
  -C# fundamentals: syntax, variables, conditionals, loops, methods, collections, and working with objects </strong>

<h2>I have a fairly decent understanding of the following:</h2>
  <strong>-WPF
  
  -WinForms
  
  -HTML
  
  -CSS
  
  -Intermediate/Advanced C#: OOP, enums, generics, events, abstract classes, interfaces, and method overriding

  -Git and Github </strong>

  -T-SQL and SQL Server Management Studio

  <h2>I have been exposed to the following in a limited way:</h2>

  -Connecting to API's

  -Javascript

  -Razor Pages

  <h2>Plan Going Forward</h2>

  Going forward, my plan is to continue practicing the things I have learned on a regular basis through direct practice and by developing additional projects. I hope to continue making desktop applications using WPF and WinForms as well as simple console applications to practice the fundamentals. 

  That being said, while implementing practice of things I already have learned, my plan for the immediate future is to create several web applications. I would like to create some basic HTML and CSS pages and then implement this knowledge in the creation of websites using Razor Pages, MVC Framework, and Blazor. Once I have created projects in these technologies, I would like to learn how to use MAUI to create mobile applications. 

  After gaining experience in these areas, I would like to begin learning how to use Unity to develop video games and Python for its versatility. I would also like to explore music creation using Python.

  If I can gain knowledge in all of these areas, I would also like to learn Javascript for its widespread use and to have another means of creating websites beyond the .Net technology stack.

# Contribution

This repo is meant for the purpose of organizing information and personal practice only. As such, I do not expect any contribution to this repo. 

# Credits

While I created this repository, the idea for it came from Tim Corey's suggestion in his GitHub Accelerate course on IAmTimCorey.com.
