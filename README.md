# About

This repository serves as a personal roadmap, documenting things that I have learned as well as containing a list of things I still intend, Lord willing, to learn as it relates to software development. It also functions as a central location to display links to my most relevant projects on GitHub. Finally, this repository will be a place for me to practice various coding fundamentals and to preserve that practice for future reference. 

# How to Use

The files in this repository do not represent a single project but rather are a place for me to upload my practice of various coding languages/tools. The Personal Roadmap section details what I have spent time learning up until this point and the things I would like to learn going forward. The Project Links section contains links to my projects here on GitHub that I would like to display. 

# Personal Roadmap

<h2>I have gained a solid understanding of the following:</h2>

  <strong>-IDE's: Visual Studio 2019-2022 and Visual Studio Code
  
  -C# fundamentals: syntax, variables, conditionals, loops, methods, collections, and working with objects </strong>

<h2>I have a fairly decent understanding of the following:</h2>
  
  <strong>-WPF
  
  -WinForms
  
  -HTML
  
  -CSS
  
  -Intermediate/Advanced C#: OOP, enums, generics, events, abstract classes, interfaces, and method overriding

  -Git and Github </strong>

  -T-SQL and SQL Server Management Studio

  <h2>I have been exposed to the following in a limited way:</h2>
  <strong>
  -Connecting to API's

  -Javascript

  -Razor Pages

  -MVC

  -JSON Files

  </strong>

  <h2>Plan Going Forward</h2>

  Going forward, my plan is to continue practicing the things I have learned on a regular basis through direct practice and by developing additional projects. I hope to continue making desktop applications using WPF and WinForms as well as simple console applications to practice the fundamentals. 

  That being said, while implementing practice of things I already have learned, my plan for the immediate future is to create several web applications. I would like to create some basic HTML and CSS pages and then implement this knowledge in the creation of websites using Razor Pages, MVC, and Blazor. While learning more about web development, I would like to spend some time becoming more familiar with:

    -API's
    -App settings JSON files
    -Logging
    -Legal information regarding publishing websites and/or desktop applications
    -Keeping data secure
    -The process of hosting and deploying websites and databases
    -I may have to learn a little about Entity Framework to make use of the authentication functionality built into Razor Pages and MVC
    -How to properly publish applications for business or personal use
  
  After developing several projects in the previously mentioned technologies, my plan is to begin working with MAUI. While learning MAUI, I also intend to expand my knowledge of data access in a supplemental way. I already have a decent grasp of T-SQL and SQL Server Management Studio, but I would like to learn more about ADO.Net Connections and Entity Framework as well as other forms of data access. 

  Once I develop a few projects using MAUI, I need to evaluate which technologies to learn next or which areas to re-visit. Some of the areas I would like to explore are:
  
  - Game development using Unity
  - Music creation using code (Python?)
  - Python
  - COBOL
    
  <h2>Tentative Schedule*</h2>

  -Sunday: N/A
  
  -Monday: Practice C# Fundamentals & Develop Desktop Applications 
  
  -Tuesday: Practice/Learn HTML and CSS & Develop Web Applications
  
  -Wednesday: Practice C# Fundamentals & Spend Time Learning New Skills
  
  -Thursday: Practice/Learn HTML and CSS & Develop Web Applications
  
  -Friday: Supplemental Learning* & Spend Time Learning New Skills
  
  -Saturday: Supplemental Learning* & Develop Web Applications

  *This schedule may be tweaked as I move forward in my learning process. 

  **Includes areas of learning that are not the primary focus but may be beneficial in filling certain knowledge gaps such as API's, JSON files/app settings and configuration, logging, legal information, 
  information about the process of publishing websites, data security, additional methods of data access, and any other topics that arise which appear to be pertinent to my learning process.
