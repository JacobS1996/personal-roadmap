# About

This repository serves as a personal roadmap, documenting things that I have learned as well as containing a list of things I still intend, Lord willing, to learn as it relates to software development. It also functions as a central location to display links to my most relevant projects on GitHub. Finally, this repository will be a place for me to practice various coding fundamentals and to preserve that practice for future reference. 

# How to Use

The files in this repository do not represent a single project but rather are a place for me to upload my practice of various coding languages/tools. The Personal Roadmap section details what I have spent time learning up until this point and the things I would like to learn going forward. The Project Links section contains links to my projects here on GitHub that I would like to display. 

# Personal Roadmap

<h2>I have gained a solid understanding of the following:</h2>

  <strong>-IDE's: Visual Studio 2019-2022 and Visual Studio Code
  
  -C# fundamentals: syntax, variables, conditionals, loops, methods, collections, and working with objects </strong>

<h2>I have a fairly decent understanding of the following:</h2>
  <strong>-WPF
  
  -WinForms
  
  -HTML
  
  -CSS
  
  -Intermediate/Advanced C#: OOP, enums, generics, events, abstract classes, interfaces, and method overriding

  -Git and Github </strong>

  -T-SQL and SQL Server Management Studio

  <h2>I have been exposed to the following in a limited way:</h2>

  -Connecting to API's

  -Javascript

  -Razor Pages

  <h2>Plan Going Forward</h2>

  Going forward, my plan is to continue practicing the things I have learned on a regular basis through direct practice and by developing additional projects. I hope to continue making desktop applications using WPF and WinForms as well as simple console applications to practice the fundamentals. 

  That being said, while implementing practice of things I already have learned, my plan for the immediate future is to create several web applications. I would like to create some basic HTML and CSS pages and then implement this knowledge in the creation of websites using Razor Pages, MVC Framework, and Blazor. This process will also include becoming more familiar with API's. While I am primarily focused on learning these technologies, I still plan to spend a small amount of time on coding days practicing fundamentals and learning Javascript.
  
  After developing several projects in the previously mentioned technologies, my plan is to expand my understanding of data access. I currently understand how to use T-SQL in connection with SQL Server Management Studio, and I know how to link a database with an application using Dapper. I would like to become more familiar with ADO.Net connections as well as alternative forms of data acccess. I would also like to spend some time gaining a better understanding of deploying an application as a finished product. 

  Once I have a handle on these things, I intend to start learning MAUI. Once I develop a few projects using MAUI, I need to evaluate which technologies to learn next or which areas to re-visit. Some of the areas I would like to explore are:
  
  - Game development using Unity
  - Music creation using code (Python?)
  - Python
  - COBOL

# Contribution

This repo is meant for the purpose of organizing information and personal practice only. As such, I do not expect any contribution to this repo. 

# Credits

While I created this repository, the idea for it came from Tim Corey's suggestion in his GitHub Accelerate course on IAmTimCorey.com.
